INTRODUCTION                                                    *FindYamlKey*

With this plugin nested keys can be easily found in a YAML document.

REQUIREMENTS~

VIM needs to be compiled with Ruby support. The plugin will fail gracefully if
not supported.

USAGE~

:FindYamlKey {pattern}

    Search recursively in the current buffer for yaml keys.
    For example

    :FindYamlKey foo.bar.baz

    Will place the cursor under the |baz| key in this YAML document:

    maunz:
      braunz: "mew"
    foo:
      bar:
        baz: "hello world"
